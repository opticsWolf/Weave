Weave is a powerful modular, node-based graphical interface framework built on PySide6, designed for constructing, editing, and executing visual workflows. It enables users to create complex processing pipelines through an intuitive drag-and-drop node graph system, supporting extensibility, custom node types, and scalable architecture for performance-critical applications.
